# Usage

## Requirements

ember-cli-stickybits is used in production with an Ember 2.4.
So it should work with newer ember version.

## Browser compatibility

This addon use an internal WeaMap which limit [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap#Browser_compatibility)
but [Stickybits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits#browser-compatibility) has already a compatibility > IE9 so it should be fine for most cases.


## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-cli-stickybits
```
